As every programmer, Google, Stack Overflow and other people’s personal blogs are part of the tools I use almost daily when I need to solve a problem which I didn’t face before.

A lot of years ago I maintained a series of documents with notes explaining how I did solve some problems I found in different projects, they were like my personal HOWTOs and they were very useful because a lot of solutions are very specific and it wasn’t always easy to find them through the internet and the likelihood of facing the same problem again after you have face it once is quite high if you’re working in the same project for a long time developing or doing maintenance.

Because of the proliferation of asked questions in Stack Overflow and personal blogs related with almost everything subject you can imagine this last years the necessity to keep maintaining those personal HOWTOs almost disappeared because most of the times is faster to do a search in Google or Stack Overflow and find the solution to your problem, or at least I thought that.

With the time I realized that for some of my specific problems I have to go through a quite large list of Stack Overflow answers and pages until I found the solution that I need, sometimes the solution is the result of putting together information from different sources, and as before once you are working in a project for some time it’s quite possible that you need to solve the same problem more than once and repeat the same unsuccessful searches before find the solution again.

So this blog is my personal solution to avoid the need of doing the same searches again when I need to solve a problem I already solved in the past. This blog contains my personal HOWTOs, nothing more.

If you’re reading this and you’re thinking that my English sucks, you’re right. I’m not an English native speaker and my English really sucks, I know, but I think it doesn’t make much sense to write the blog using my native language as it is a programming centred blog.
